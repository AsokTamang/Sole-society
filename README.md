I built this shopping website while I was learning about advanced React as well as basics of express.js.
So I still have lot of features to add into this software, but the frontend parts are almost done and now I'm learning to include data authentication as well as the database connection into this software.
And I will add the functionality of finding the stores to buy the product from this app. So I'm learning step by step for all this purposes, And I promise that I'll make the final form of this sole society software which is an online web app to buy the shoes.
